## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Library we will use:
```{r library(tidy)}
library(tidyverse) #We can also include a label which will be important for debuging later on
```

And load data we already wrangled:
```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state: 
```{r pressure, echo=F}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb,rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) + geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "red") + coord_flip()
#plot that won't include the code because of the Echo. 
```

#Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Note that to convert the markdown file to a document we need the package knitr. R also includes a button above to make it easier **knit**
